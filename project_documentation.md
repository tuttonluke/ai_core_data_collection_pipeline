(brief description of the project)

## Milestone 1
Technologies / Skills:
- Web Scraping (HTML, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, uuid)

I love books and romance languages, so I decided to scrape data of Spanish and Portuguese language authors from the website of popular British bookseller Waterstones. A webscraping class WaterstonesScraper was built using Selenium to drive the chrome browser. Methods of this class include those to load the page, accept cookies, navigate a search query, and scrape links for all books from the given query.
